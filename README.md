This project is to build an Etch-A-Sketch game, where the requirements are from  [The Etch A Sketch project in TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

I **worked** with, including but not limited to: 
1. Manipulating DOM.
    1. Using the document.querySelector.
    2. Changing a div's Style properties.
2. Creating JavaScript methods.
    1. Using the Function.
    2. Using the addEventListener.
    3. Using ` e ` (event), and passing it to a Function.
8. Creating a CSS file.

The ***hardest*** thing was to understand how to link a button with a JavaScript function. This could be done via passing the `e ` or document.querySelectorAll, and others.

Nevertheless, it felt satisfying to finish the project, and I look forward to the next adventure.
